# Python Password Checker
![secret login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d652a126-1219-488f-ac0e-e47c9e35b25a)

Ever wondered if the password you are about to enter has ever been hacked previously?

This script can check if your password has ever been hacked, and if so how many times, this has happened.

### How to use
1. Install the required packages by running `pip install requests`
2. Run the script with python `python3 checkmypass.py`, with passwords you'd like to check
Example:
``` bash
python3 checkmypass.py hello vwoiepgjbhewreq
```
3. The script will print out the results for each password.

### Future Additions
Currently, you must enter the passwords with the script. In the near future, you will be able to add a text file, with lists of passwords, to the script and check results.
